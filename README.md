# Source Demo Crawler
```⚠️WORK IN PROGRESS⚠️```

This tool is being developed alongside [Source Demo Tool](https://github.com/xNWP/source-demo-tool).

Currently the tool only supports the displaying/browsing of some of a demo files contents. Future plans are to expand the viewable content, implement a map switching feature for modifying demos, and modifying demos generally.
