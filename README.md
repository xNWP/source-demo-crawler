# Source Demo Crawler
```⚠️WORK IN PROGRESS⚠️```

This tool is being developed alongside [Source Demo Tool](https://github.com/xNWP/source-demo-tool).

Currently the tool only supports the displaying/browsing of some of a demo files contents. Future plans are to expand the viewable content, implement a map switching feature for modifying demos, and modifying demos generally.

Checkout `CHANGELOG.md` for details on the current state of the tool, and checkout the tags for specific releases. `main` should always be stable and you should be able to build from the latest main commit with no errors, if you do have problems, please [open an issue](https://github.com/xNWP/source-demo-crawler/issues).
